Component name: libs\books\feature\src\lib\book-search\book-search.component.ts


1. Method Naming
    The method searchExample() is not self-explanatory. It could be more descriptive and meaningful, like DefaultSearchTerm().

2. Date formatting logic
    The formatDate function in the component is handling date formatting. While it's functional, Angular provides a date pipe which is more maintainable and should be preferred for template usage

3. Improper handling of void in Date formatting logic
    in formatDate function, the input type allows void | string. void is not a valid type in this logic.
    Instead of using void, we can change to string | undefined

4. Error handling for invalid form states
    You aren't handling cases where the form might be invalid. For instance, if additional validation is added to the form, there should be checks for form validity before dispatching actions.

    For exmple:
    
    searchBooks() {
    if (this.searchForm.value.term.invalid) {
        return;
    }
    if (this.searchForm.value.term) {
      this.store.dispatch(searchBooks({ term: this.searchTerm }));
    } else {
      this.store.dispatch(clearSearch());
    }
  }
